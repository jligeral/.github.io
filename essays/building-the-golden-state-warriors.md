In sports a 'dynasty' is a team or individual that dominates their sport for some extended period of time, usually in the form of winning multiple consecutive championships and a lasting legacy. In the NBA, Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls and Kobe Bryant and Shaq's Los Angeles Lakers are two of the most iconic dynasties to have ever come about. Today the Golden State Warriors are easily regarded as the latest NBA dynasty, with them having won four championships within the last decade. Though much of their success is attributed to the collection and retention of star talent, it's very difficult to ignore the overall team's effectiveness on the court. Thus it is not an individual Michael Jordan nor a Phil Jackson nor a Scottie Pippen that wins championships, but the rather the combination of them and everyone else on the team and organization that succeeds.

I wanted to build something I considered impressive by the end of my software engineering class, and I wanted to use that project to help me display my level of knowledge and skill in coding and research to future employers. Besides the professional portfolio hosting all of these essays and project summaries, this project was to be the most valuable tangible benefit of taking this class. But of course, this was not an individual project. This project would ultimately be built with the help of three other students in my class, and while I did learn a lot during the building phase of the project, I think my main two takeaways from the experience were 1) Being able to research APIs to use in projects and 2) Learning about what *not* to do when leading a group project.

## Leading a project

The final project initially began as a submission for the Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge (HACC). HACC registration did not require a team, but realistically as someone with no prior experience or knowledge in full stack development participating with a team made the most sense. Quickly, I managed to team up with three others in my class. And when it came time to submit our application we had to choose a team leader to submit everything. Selecting me as leader came (unsurprisngly) quick since everyone else prefered not to be in that position. It was after this point in the project that quickly came to undertand two (major) things in terms of project team management. 

1. The team will not do anything until specific plans or instructions are made. For the very first week of the competition, we did not do anything. At the very most, we agreed on a challenge to take on, but did not plan out anything beyond that. This isn't for lack of trying; Neither of us knew how to make a functioning chatbot so understandedly there weren't a lot of concrete ideas in mind on how to do the challenge. On my end, I would watch tutorials and try them out on my free time and commit the work to GitHub to use as reference for future projects. I'd share what I learned with the group on Discord, but there was never much discussion beyond that. The problem I had was that I didn't actually know what was going on with the other team members. Were they working on something else on their own time? Were they confused about some aspect of the challenge? These questions lead me to my next point.
2. Team commitment was not equal amongst all team members. I brought up motivations earlier about using this project as a display of skill for future employers. But it's also important that I also possessed a strong desire to win. Although all three of my other team members agreed to work with me, it was presumptuous to assume that they too carried the same level of intent to win as I did. It wasn't until a week to the HACC submission deadline that I felt we started to communicate more and work as a group. If there is one thing I will remember during my experience, it's staying up for nearly 36 hours trying to finish the chatbot with one other team member.
