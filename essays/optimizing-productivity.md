Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a transformative role in both education and software engineering. In education, AI facilitates personalized learning experiences by tailoring educational content to individual student needs, tracking progress, and providing timely feedback. AI-driven tools also assist educators in automating administrative tasks, enabling them to focus more on personalized instruction. In software engineering, AI enhances efficiency through automated code generation, bug detection, and optimization. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast datasets to identify patterns, improving software development processes and aiding in predictive maintenance. Additionally, AI contributes to the evolution of adaptive software systems, allowing for real-time adjustments based on user behavior and preferences. Overall, in education and software engineering, AI serves as a catalyst for innovation, fostering more effective learning environments and accelerating advancements in software development practices.

This is pretty cliched, but the paragraph above is AI-generated. I do, however, genuinely believe that AI only helps to improve productivity in the classroom and in software engineering. I believe my personal experiences using it are testimony to its usefulness in the classroom and in professional work. Finally, at its current state, I also believe that one can use it poorly, and that using it well is a skill to develop.

## Initial Hesitation

This was my first semester actively using generative AI. No, I wasn't ignorant of its existence - In fact I used it a quite a bit in recreational activities when ChatGPT and DALL-E gained popularity a few years ago. Chat-GPT was what I primarily used, and I had it write up D&D stories, lesson plans to learn and practice Japanese over the summer, and answer questions I'd normally just ask on Google. But I never really considered using it for school, and this was mainly motivated by a fear of falling into a trap of becoming dependent on using it. Something important to understand about me is that <b>I learn a lot through failure</b>. Calculus? Organic chemistry? Biochemistry? These subjects weren't a walk in the park for me. I actively spent a lot of time struggling through material trying to understand concepts and recognize patterns in these subjects. Even in the second semester of Introduction to Computer Science, I initially struggled trying to get a basic array of size 5 to work the way I wanted it to. But it was a process of constantly trying again and again that ultimately proved fruitful in my success with these classes. I attribute these moments of struggle to traumatic experiences in that they sort of remain with me for a long time because of the hardship endured.

And so my initial belief was that incorporating AI would actively harm my ability to learn and understand material. Software Engineering is the only class I've taken that has either encouraged or allowed use of generative AI. 

## Trivializing Coding Prompts

Software Engineering had weekly assessments called Workout of the Day (WOD) which were timed coding exercises. At the start of the class the instructor would briefly describe the exercise, and then within a given time restraint I would have to return a solution to it. As far as I can recall, every WOD allowed the use of generative AI and during submission we would be asked to to answer if we used it during the exercise or not. I will admit that I failed the first two WODs, and chose not to use ChatGPT or any other assistant during my attempts. To this day, it still bothers me that I failed those two. But as I pointed out in the previous section, the solutions to those exercises was burned into my memory. What about the other other WODs though? I actually passed almost every WOD afterwards, but it also marked the start my use of AI in my work for the class.

One of the inital challenges coming into class was learning a new coding language. The expectation was to learn JavaScript within a week, and while I thought I fihured out the basics my failures with the first two WODs had me question that belief. I remember the exact moment my opinion on using AI changed: During a practice group WOD, I managed to write up a solution fairly easily and very quickly. I was surprised to learn, however, that one of my group partners had already finished the exercise. Curious to know how he managed to accomplish this so quickly, he explained that GitHub Copilot had done most of the work for him. Somehow I felt humbled, but I realized then that AI could be used to generate code for simple processes. After the third WOD, I used it every time I was stuck on something. And during one point I learned you could paste an entire WOD prompt to generate a correct solution, but eventually we moved on from pure JavaScript to building UI with HTML, CSS, and UI frameworks. I don't believe I ever used AI for the completion of those exercises besides the rare occassion when one of my CSS styles wasn't working for some reason.

## The Final Project

I decided to participate in the Hawaii Coding Challenge this year, and also use it for my final project for Software Engineering. Of the five challenges presented, my team decided to work on one where we were tasked with implementing an AI to help students and faculty of the university navigate through the IT department's help article database. I initially wanted to avoid participating in this challenge because I felt that building an AI tool was not within my scope of knowledge, but conveniently a tutorial on building an AI chatbot was sent to me via a FreeCodeCamp newsletter. After watching through a couple minutes of the video and learning what its techstack was, I gained confidence in the team's ability to do the challenge. At that point in time, I had probably been actively using ChatGPT for a little over a month in most of my classes. I found that using it to kickstart assignments or design a gameplan for them helped me overcome slow starts. I fed ChatGPT information on the goals of the challenge and the technology I planned to use, and it returned to me an initial plan that I would use to realize building the application with my team.
