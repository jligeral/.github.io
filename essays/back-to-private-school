After completing sixth grade, my aprents decided to emroll me into private school. At the time, it was a sort of exciting experience - There was always this idea I had about it being much better than my public school experiences. I anticipated meeting smarter classmates, and better quality teachers, and being in state-of-the-art classrooms. What I didn't anticipate was a sudden change in dresscode policy. Yep, I was required to wear a uniform to school now. And my shoes had to be black, and I had to wear a belt, although we had the option to buy our uniform shorts in a variety of colors - We were actually restricted to only wearing navy blue, forrest green, and red shirts. Up until about a year ago, I never really thought about *why* uniforms at school were a things. It really seemed trivial to me, but apprently we have some historical and cultural motivations for keeping them in schools.

## How Conforming can Improve an Environment

I was specifically learning about Confucianism and Buddhism when I learned the significance of school uniforms. The ideas were simple and immediately made sense to me - Basically uniforms promoted an overall sense of equality. Enforcing a strict dress code meant that no one could flaunt their wealth, or distract others with flashy or provacative clothes. This would minimize distractions, bullying, and various other opportunities for disrespect. And as someone having been in private school for at least six years, I can personally attest to that. The general idea is to promote an environment that nurtured learning and professionalism. When you put on the school uniform, you were a student of your chosen institution, first and foremost - Or at least that was the intent of the dresscode policy. One can still express their individuality through other means such as displaying skill at certain subjects or activities. But again, the uniform helps to highlight that this individual is a part of the school and works for more than just themself.

And all this talk about dresscode brings me to coding standards. While its intent isn't one-to-one identical to that of a strict dresscode, they both accomplish the goal that individualism is minimized to a level that everyone is on the same team and a certain level of productivity is maintained.

## My Exposure to Coding Standards

I was personally introduced to the idea of coding standards a little over a year ago, when I took the course Introduction to Computer Science. My professor brought up coding standards during the second or third week of classes, and had a concise document available for us to read so that we knew ahead of time what his expectations were for us in regards to assignments to be submitted. I recall that commentation was what he personally emphasized on when it came to grading - He really wanted us to comment on almost every single significant line of code in our programs. Why was this important? Well he explained that pretty early on too - If we work on project with a team, it's important that our team members understand what we are trying to accomplish with our code. Our professor provided very clear instructions on what our programs were supposed to output, but he wanted to put us in the habit of commenting because he felt that would be important moving forward. I tend to agree.

Currently, coding standards are bing enforced
