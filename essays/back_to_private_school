After completing sixth grade, my aprents decided to emroll me into private school. At the time, it was a sort of exciting experience - There was always this idea I had about it being much better than my public school experiences. I anticipated meeting smarter classmates, and better quality teachers, and being in state-of-the-art classrooms. What I didn't anticipate was a sudden change in dresscode policy. Yep, I was required to wear a uniform to school now. And my shoes had to be black, and I had to wear a belt, although we had the option to buy our uniform shorts in a variety of colors - We were actually restricted to only wearing navy blue, forrest green, and red shirts. Up until about a year ago, I never really thought about *why* uniforms at school were a things. It really seemed trivial to me, but apprently we have some historical and cultural motivations for keeping them in schools.

## How Conforming can Improve an Environment

I was specifically learning about Confucianism and Buddhism when I learned the significance of school uniforms. The ideas were simple and immediately made sense to me - Basically uniforms promoted an overall sense of equality. Enforcing a strict dress code meant that no one could flaunt their wealth, or distract others with flashy or provacative clothes. This would minimize distractions, bullying, and opportunities for disrespect.
