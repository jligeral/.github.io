I am a second or third year student of computer science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and so far I have completed five different cources pertaining to computer science. Only three of these courses involved writing code. I started learning how to code with Java in the courses ICS 111 and ICS 211, both of which were introductory computer science courses. The third class, ICS 212 Program Structure had us learn to use C (primarily) and C++. I am going to admit: I don't think I was fully confident about my skills or knowledge in Java before I went and did ICS 212. This isn't to say that my professor did a bad job - No, I believe they did an excellent job of guiding me. But there's so much, I personally felt, that I still had to learn.

And here I am today, taking three more computer science courses this semester. One course, ICS 314 Software Engineering, has me learning another new language Javascript. But here's the kicker, I had one week to grasp the basics this time.

## Similarity in syntax

FreeCodeCamp was the primary resource provided to help me start walking in class. I've actually used it before to learn CSS and HTML over a summer once so I was already familiar with how the site functioned. Essentially, the site breaks down major concepts in basic programming and packages them each into small exercises that the user then completes which should result in a better understanding of the concept. It's not unlike the assignments I did for ICS 111, which were all exercises that helped me learn how to print statements, learn how to declare and initialize variables, utilize arrays, and create functions. Overall, it took a few hours within a couple of days to get through all the basic content, and now I'm capable to solving simple problems using Javascript.

What really helped me to learn the material as quickly as I did was my prior knowledge of Java and C. After the first week of ICS 212, my professor asked the class about how we felt about C and had us compare it to Java. I appreciated that most of the logic behind the languages and the syntax of both were largely similar. Again today, I appreciate how Javascript is also similar to Java and C. We call each of these a language, but it's very different from learning Japanese and English and Spanish - It's more like learning how to speak English in this accents. 

## A new approach to learning

The short deadline to learn the basics of Javascript would also 

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
