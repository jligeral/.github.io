## Prerequisite knowledge.

Before this semester started, I attended a New Student Orientation. We began the orientation in a large chemistry classroom, where someone from the faculty described all the different services available to us via the Campus Center. As she did this, she also answered questions in real time pertaining to the subject matter she address via mobile application. One student asked "Where can we park, and how do we pay for it?" The faculty member paused for a brief moment before asking a follow-up question "Did we all be sure to look through the New Student Orientation modules on Laulima before attending?" She then reminded everyone to look through them if they haven't already and that the answers to those questions would be found in them, specifically in the module about Commuter Services. I personally thought it was a harmless and simple question, but I've experienced this multiple times before. Many times, even.

Even within my circle of friends, I can be called out for asking a simple question. When does this game release? How much will it cost at launch? Should I play its predecessor before playing it? I sometimes see these questions asked on a Discord server, only to be met with aggressive responses telling the asker to use Google instead, even if everyone else could just answer the question themselves. I guess from my perspective, if I can Google the answer in a matter of seconds, why can't you? I don't mean to be rude, but I can understand that questions can lead others to believe the asker to be lazy. And I do want to clarify: I don't really believe in stupid questions if I think the asker is being genuine. But I do believe that there are appropriate and inappropriate times to ask "bad" or "stupid" questions, no matter how genuine the asker is.

## So who and when should I ask bad and dumb questions?

Definitely ask friends you know are willing to answer any question you ask. And, honestly, that's probably it. But if they don't have an answer for your question, then be prepared to either do some research of your own or look for the right experts who can answer your question. A couple weeks ago, I decided to go and fix a leak in my shower and bathtub. My initial action towards repairing the leak involved searching "leaking shower faucet" on Youtube. Many results came up, and I took some time to watch each and see if any of the leaks matched the one mine was exhibiting. I finally learned that the leak was the result of a faulty or old shower cartridge that was located behind the handle that controlled bothe the flow of water through the faucet, and the temperature of the water. What I didn't know was how to access the cartridge, what model type the cartridge was, and what I would need to even repair it. Luckily I happened to be friends with a former plumber. I called him, described what I was trying to do, and what my problems were, and he was quickly able to send me a tutorial video on the exact type of shower I was using. After that, fixing the shower extremely doable.

This story was meant to describe how one should approach asking for help. I did a preliminary amount of research and work before hitting a wall. Then I approached an expert, and provided them with all the knowledge I collected earlier, so that he could provide me with the rest of the information I required to solve my problem. The same goes for school - I took Japanese my last three semesters and always relied on a tutor to help me practice for oral examinations. But time with the tutor was limited since she was also at the service of several other Japanese students, and had a life of her own to take of. I couldn't very well just approach her, without having studied a bit and practiced beforehand - That could easily result in a waste of time. With my computer science classes, I'd sometimes get stuck implementing a data structure or fixing a bug when working on a class project. One resource I learned about, through social media, was Stack Overflow. I personally came upon it a few times while asking certain Java-related questions on Google.

## The foolproof way to get ignored.

While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, a user asks how he would, in short, create a desktop application with Facebook.

```
Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update onfacebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with facebook?
```

A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
