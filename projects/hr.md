HR was the very first real assignment I completed for ICS 211. During our first week, we were tasked with defining an Employee object, which stored information on an employee's unique number, name, and salary, in Java then defining its exceptions - That served as a review of ICS 111 material. Using those, we were then tasked with writing a program which would add employees to an array and sort them via a self-repeating text menu.

This assignment set the tone for the rest of the course as it really tested my knowledge of arrays, iteration, accessing object properties, and validating input. ICS 111 assignments built off of previous assignments, but mainly tested our understanding of the last topic we learned. This assignment felt like what would have been a final project for ICS 111.
