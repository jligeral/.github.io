This is the first graphical user interface program I ever made. The player goes up against a random number generator, and wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of of three symbols (in this case "x's").

I personally learned a lot completing this assignment, from discovering how boolean values can act as "switches," the complexity of enforcing rules in games, and the importance of functions in creating clean and readable code. I can even say that the assignment sparked an interest in trying to develop another simple game in the future.
